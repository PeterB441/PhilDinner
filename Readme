Every time the philosopher tries to take an action, a coinflip is made to determine if it will eat or think
This is done to prevent deadlocks, by making sure that all philosiphers will probably take different actions than their neightbours
And if they do all somehow try to eat at the same time, it will result in them all flipping a new coin in the next cycle
